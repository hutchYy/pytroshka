### Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah

I zipped the file a bit too many times it seems... and I may have added passwords to some of the zip files... eh, they should be pretty common passwords right?

File given : 1819.gz

### What to do with the file ?

After some analysis the archive contain 1819 nested archives(zip, tar). Each zip are protected by a password so we have to crack it with the previded wordlist.
